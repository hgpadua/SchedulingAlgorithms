# SchedulingAlgorithms

The objectives of this assignment are to simulate the CPU scheduling of several processes for the configured First-Come First-Served, preemptive Shortest Job First, and Round-Robin CPU scheduling algorithms.Therefore the algorithm will need to be selected/configured as well as the processes and their durations and burst cycles, as appropriate.

The command line inputs or cli are the input file name as the first parameter and the output file name as the second parameter. 

For example: ./pa1 c5-fcfs.in c5-fcfs.stu where the filesâ€™ extensions correspond to input and student.
